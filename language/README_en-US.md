## Prerequisites

1. A domain name resolved to your server
2. Ubuntu/Debian system
3. Root privileges
4. Running backend service

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChuranNeko/quick-site-deployment.git
# or use Gitee
git clone https://gitee.com/ChuranNeko/quick-site-deployment.git
```

2. Enter the project directory:
```bash
cd quick-site-deployment
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
# Use English version script
sudo bash deploy_en.sh

# Use Chinese version script
sudo bash deploy.sh
```

> Note: Both scripts have identical functionality, they only differ in the language of prompts and comments. Choose the version that suits you best.

4. Enter the following information when prompted:
   - Your domain name
   - Your email address (for SSL certificate)
   - Your backend service port number

## Important Notes

1. Domain Configuration:
   - Ensure the domain is correctly resolved to your server IP
   - Supports subdomains

2. Port Configuration:
   - Default port is 7001
   - Can be modified according to actual needs
   - Ensure the port is not occupied by other services

3. SSL Certificate:
   - Automatically requests Let's Encrypt certificates
   - Configures automatic certificate renewal
   - Certificates are valid for 90 days
   - System will automatically renew before expiration

4. Security Notes:
   - Script automatically configures firewall
   - Only opens ports 80 and 443
   - Enables automatic HTTPS redirection

## Common Issues

1. If you encounter "This script must be run as root":
   - Run the script with sudo

2. If you encounter "No service listening on port":
   - Check if the backend service is running properly
   - Verify the port number is correct

3. If you encounter domain resolution errors:
   - Check if DNS resolution is correct
   - Wait for DNS propagation (usually takes a few minutes to hours)
